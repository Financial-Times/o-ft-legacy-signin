# FT Legacy Signin Module <small>o-ft-legacy-signin</small>

Provides basic functionality for recognising, displaying and managing a user's signed in state and allowing a user to login.

** This module provides a temporary origami-compatible interface for the legacy sign-in infrastructure of FT.com. It should generally not be used in your product, in favour of waiting for the new membership API (and a corresponding origami module) to go into production. If, however, you need to use this legacy version please contact rhys.evans@ft.com for advice on integrating into your product. **
